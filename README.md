## 🚨 911 Shift Watch — Data Project at Le Wagon

As part of my certification at **Le Wagon**, my teammates and I developed a full-scale data project from scratch, focusing on my personal interest in **public safety**. The aim was to analyse real-time **911 call activity in city of Baltimore** and deliver actionable insights to support first responders and decision-makers.

### 📌 Project Goal
Create an **interactive real-time dashboard** for 911 operators and respondents to:
- Monitor call volumes by police district or neighbourhood in any time period  
- Analyse reasons for calls and detect patterns  
- Predict future call trends using machine learning
  
### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **City of Baltimore API** — real-time call data extraction  
- **BigQuery** — data loading and transformation  
- **Google Gemini** — data formatting and standardisation  
- **Python** — data transformation and ML modelling  
- **n8n** — workflow automation  
- **Looker Studio** — interactive dashboard
